                This is my portfolio website (no duh!). It has gone through several different iterations as I have made it...
            </p>
            <p>
                It initially was built on vanilla html, css, and javascript. This however, became really annoying. For example, I would have to constantly keep rebuilding the divs and classnames for the project section over and over again, repeating the same lines of code. That is why I then opted to convert the website over to react. I was also able to make it a single page application so there are not any page refreshes anymore.
